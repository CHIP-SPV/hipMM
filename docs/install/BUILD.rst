Building and installing hipMM from Source
=========================================

In the following, we give a detailed overview on how to build the C++
components, how to run the tests and the benchmarks, and how to build
the full hipMM installation including the Python package.

Build procedure for C++ components
----------------------------------

Building the C++/HIP components of hipMM can be achieved via the
following command

.. code:: bash

   ./build.sh lib tests benchmarks

Here, ``tests`` and ``benchmarks`` are optional flags that enable the
respective additional functionalities.

.. note::

   In order to fetch the dependencies ``git`` needs to be
   installed on your system.

Running tests and benchmarks
----------------------------

To run the tests use:

.. code:: bash

   ctest --test-dir cpp/build/

To run the benchmarks use:

.. code:: bash

   find cpp/build/benchmarks/ -type f -executable -exec {} \;


Build & Installation Procedure of hipMM including the Python layer
------------------------------------------------------------------

You will perform the following steps:

1. `Install Conda <#step-1-install-conda>`__
2. `Clone the hipMM
   repository <#step-2-clone-the-hipmm-repository>`__
3. `Create and activate hipMM Conda environment <#step-3-create-and-activate-the-hipmm-conda-environment>`__
4. `Build and install hipMM <#step-4-build-and-install-hipmm>`__
5. `Verify correctness of
   installation <#step-5-verify-correct-installation>`__

Step 1: Install conda
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

hipMM must be built inside of a predefined Conda environment to ensure
that it is working properly. While the hipMM build process fetches C++
dependencies itself, it has Cython and Python dependencies (CuPy, Numba
HIP, hipMM, HIP Python, ROCm LLVM Python) that need to be installed into
the hipMM Conda environment before you can build and use the package.

On an x86 Linux machine it is possible to download and install
`Miniforge <https://conda-forge.org/download/>`__ via

.. code:: bash

   wget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh
   sh Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh

For other architectures and operating systems take a look at the webpage
of `Miniforge <https://conda-forge.org/download/>`__.

Step 2: Clone the hipMM repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We create a work directory ``/tmp/hipmm`` and clone hipMM into this
repository:

.. code:: bash

   mkdir -p /tmp/hipmm # NOTE: feel free to adapt

   cd /tmp/hipmm
   git clone https://github.com/ROCm-DS/hipMM hipmm -b release/rocmds-ga-25.10

Step 3: Create and activate the hipMM conda environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given the below conda environment (``rocm-70_build_release-x86_64.yaml``):

.. code:: yaml

   channels:
   - rapidsai
   - rapidsai-nightly
   - conda-forge
   dependencies:
   - c-compiler
   - clang-tools==16.0.6
   - clang==16.0.6
   - cmake>=3.26.4,<4,!=3.30.0
   - cxx-compiler
   - cython>=3.0.0
   - fmt>=11.0.2,<12
   - gcc_linux-64=11.*
   - gcovr>=5.0
   - identify>=2.5.20
   - ipython
   - make
   - ninja
   - numpy>=1.23,<3.0a0
   - pre-commit
   - pytest
   - pytest-cov
   - python>=3.10,<3.13
   - rapids-build-backend>=0.3.0,<0.4.0.dev0
   - scikit-build-core >=0.10.0
   - spdlog>=1.14.1,<1.15
   - pip
   - pip:
   - --pre
   - --extra-index-url=https://pypi.amd.com/simple
   - rocm-llvm-python~=7.0.0
   - hip-python~=7.0.0
   - hip-python-as-cuda~=7.0.0
   - numba-hip~=0.1.3
   name: hipmm_dev

We create and activate the ``hipmm_dev`` Conda environment via:

.. code:: bash

   cd /tmp/hipmm/hipmm

   conda env create --name hipmm_dev --file rocm-70_build_release-x86_64.yaml
   conda activate hipmm_dev

Step 4: Build and install hipMM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``build.sh`` command creates the ``build`` directory in the ``cpp``
subfolder of the cloned hipMM git repository. You can build and install
``librmm`` and ``rmm`` separately, and you can also build without
installing using the ``-n`` option. Use ``build.sh -h`` to display the help
text for the script.

.. code:: bash

   (hipmm_dev) $ export CXX="hipcc"    # Cython CXX compiler, adjust according to your setup.
   (hipmm_dev) $ export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}:/opt/rocm/lib/cmake"     # Locate ROCm CMake packages
   (hipmm_dev) $ ./build.sh librmm rmm     # Build and install librmm and rmm (can also use the default ./build.sh)

**Note:** When rebuilding it is recommended to remove previous build
files. When you are using the ``./build.sh`` script, this can be
accomplished by additionally specifying ``clean``. For example:
``./build.sh clean rmm``.

Step 5: Verify correct installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You have just completed building and installing hipMM for use in the Conda
environment ``hipmm_dev``. To verify the correctness of the installation, run:

.. code:: bash

   conda activate hipmm_dev

   python3

Then enter the following code commands:

.. code:: python

   import hipmm

   print(hipmm.__version__)

You should see output that is similar to:

.. code:: text

   Python 3.12.11 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, Jun  4 2025, 14:45:31) [GCC 13.3.0] on linux
   Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
   >>> import hipmm
   >>> print(hipmm.__version__)
   '3.0.00'
