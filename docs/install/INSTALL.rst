Installing hipMM
================

You can install hipMM via AMD PyPI, which is recommended for end users, or build
and install it from source as described in :ref:`Building hipMM from source <hipmm-build>`.

Requirements
------------

System requirements can be found in :ref:`hipMM supported environments, features, and interfaces <hipmm-support>`,
including supported GPU architectures.

The steps in this guide require a Conda installation. A minimal free
version of Conda is `Miniforge <https://conda-forge.org/download/>`__.

Install hipMM via AMD PyPI
--------------------------

```{warning}

   Only install hipMM using AMD’s official package index. To ensure security, integrity, and supportability of your builds,
   consume packages exclusively from AMD’s official package index. Do not install, mirror, or resolve dependencies from any
   third‑party or unofficial indexes.

Packaged versions of hipMM and its dependencies are distributed via `AMD
PyPI <https://pypi.amd.com/rocm-7.0.2/simple>`__. This section discusses how to
install hipMM via this package index.

Create and activate a Conda environment with Python 3.12 and latest ``libstdcxx-ng`` using the
minimal environment (``conda/environments/install_rocm-latest_arch-x86_64.yaml``) as shown below:

.. code:: yaml

   channels:
     - conda-forge
   dependencies:
   - python=3.12
   - libstdcxx-ng
   - pip
   - pip:
      - --pre
      - --extra-index-url=https://pypi.amd.com/rocm-7.0.2/simple
      - rocm-llvm-python~=7.0.2
      - hip-python~=7.0.2
      - hip-python-as-cuda~=7.0.2
      - numba-hip~=0.1.3
      - amd-cupy~=13.5.1
      - amd-hipmm==3.0.0
   name: hipmm

You can install both the environment and hipMM in it with a single
command:

.. code:: bash

   conda env create -f conda/environments/install_rocm-latest_arch-x86_64.yaml

After activating the ``hipmm`` environment, you can use ``import hipmm`` in
your Python code.

Verify correct installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To verify the correctness of the installation, run:

.. code:: bash

   conda activate hipmm

   python3

Then enter the following code commands:

.. code:: python

   import hipmm

   print(hipmm.__version__)

You should see output that is similar to:

.. code:: text

   Python 3.12.11 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, Jun  4 2025, 14:45:31) [GCC 13.3.0] on linux
   Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
   >>> import hipmm
   >>> print(hipmm.__version__)
   '3.0.00'
