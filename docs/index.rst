********************************************************************
HIP Memory Manager (hipMM) documentation
********************************************************************

The HIP Memory Manager (hipMM) provides advanced GPU memory management utilities used across the ROCm-DS libraries.
Based on the RAPIDS® Memory Manager (RMM 25.02), hipMM supports efficient allocation, pooling, and data movement, ensuring
stable performance in complex, multi-library GPU workflows.

hipMM 3.0.0 improves memory usage efficiency for workloads that leverage hipDF, hipGRAPH, hipRAFT, and hipVS.

The hipMM code is open and hosted at `https://github.com/ROCm-DS/hipMM <https://github.com/ROCm-DS/hipMM>`_.

The hipMM documentation is structured as follows:
